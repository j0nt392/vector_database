    "test_repository\\chess.py": "This Python code defines a `ChessGame` class that initializes and prints a chess board, representing the starting position of the game. The `play` method starts an infinite loop where it repeatedly prints the current state of the board, but does not implement any actual gameplay logic yet (marked as TODO).",
    "test_repository\\code.py": "This Python code simulates a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players, 'X' and 'O', take turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for wins after each move and also ends in a tie if all cells are filled and no player has won.",
    "test_repository\\code2.py": "Here is a brief summary of the code in one sentence:\n\nThe code implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the computer randomly selects its move and the user inputs their own move, with the game determining the winner based on the moves chosen.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
    "test_repository\\Dart.py": "This Python code implements a simple game of Darts, where the player enters their throw (e.g., \"20\", \"T20\", or \"D20\") and tries to reach a target score of 501. The game keeps track of the current score and number of throws taken by the player, and ends when the target score is reached or exceeded.",
    "test_repository\\Poker.py": "This Python code simulates a game of poker by creating a deck of cards, shuffling it, and dealing a hand to a player. The player's hand is then displayed to the console.",
    "test_repository\\tetris.py": "Here is a brief summary of this Python code in two sentences:\n\nThis code is an implementation of the classic puzzle game Tetris using the Pygame library. The code initializes a game window, defines colors and Tetriminos (Tetris shapes), sets up a grid to represent the game board, and begins a game loop that handles user input, updates the game logic, and renders the game state."
