# Vector database for querying code-files and structures.

2024-05-09
- Query vectorspace with code or/and queries
- Persist the database with pickle
- Summarize a chosen file
- Loop through a repository and create embeddings out of the code.

So far using only OpenAI API-calls with davinci-002 for encoding embeddings.
